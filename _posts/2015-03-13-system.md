TODO: extract timer

### Timer
The beagleboard (OMAP) offers 11 general-purpose timers (*GPT_*). We used a 1-ms Tick Generation with input clock of 32.768 Hz. To setup the timer we must set the negative and positive increment register which is calculated based on the TimerClock and tick count. The OMAP guide as example configuration uses 1-ms tick and the 32.768Hz clock with a positive value of 232000 and negative of -768000. The timer load value is set to 0xFFFF FFE0 which leads to an interrupt period of 65.5 Î¼s.

As example we are using the GPT_TIMER_10 with GPT10_IRQ. This is mapped to M_IRQ_46 in the interrupt handler routines. Timer 10 and 11 are on the core module (Powerdomain *CORE*) which defaults to 32kHz clock. Timer 1 to 9 are on the Powerdomain *PER* [see p.2599]. Using overflow mode, the TLDR value or overflow rate is expressed as `OVF_Rate = (0xFFFF FFFF - GPTn.TLDR + 1) * (timer-functional clock period) * PS`. If no prescaler is used, PS=1. The timer functional clock period is `1/clock frequency`.
