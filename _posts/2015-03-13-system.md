TODO: extract timer and interrupts

### Timer
The beagleboard (OMAP) offers 11 general-purpose timers (*GPT_*). We used a 1-ms Tick Generation with input clock of 32.768 Hz. To setup the timer we must set the negative and positive increment register which is calculated based on the TimerClock and tick count. The OMAP guide as example configuration uses 1-ms tick and the 32.768Hz clock with a positive value of 232000 and negative of -768000. The timer load value is set to 0xFFFF FFE0 which leads to an interrupt period of 65.5 Î¼s.

As example we are using the GPT_TIMER_10 with GPT10_IRQ. This is mapped to M_IRQ_46 in the interrupt handler routines. Timer 10 and 11 are on the core module (Powerdomain *CORE*) which defaults to 32kHz clock. Timer 1 to 9 are on the Powerdomain *PER* [see p.2599]. Using overflow mode, the TLDR value or overflow rate is expressed as `OVF_Rate = (0xFFFF FFFF - GPTn.TLDR + 1) * (timer-functional clock period) * PS`. If no prescaler is used, PS=1. The timer functional clock period is `1/clock frequency`.

### Interrupts

The interrupt vectors must be defined in the [linker script](https://github.com/flomath/fluxos/blob/interrupts/beagleboard.cmd). They will need their own memory section. 

```
/** beagleboard.cmd **/
MEMORY
{
  SRAM:           o = 0x40200000  l = 0x0000FFC8  /* 64kB Internal SRAM */
 	DDR0:           o = 0x80000000  l = 0x40000000	/* 1GB external DDR Bank 0 */
  EXCEPTIONS:		o = 0x4020FFC8	l = 0x00000037	/* RAM exception vectors */
}

SECTIONS
{
  .intvecs    > EXCEPTIONS
...
```

The interrupt handlers are than defined in the [intvecs.asm](https://github.com/flomath/fluxos/blob/interrupts/intvecs.asm) file. Ensure that the memory addresses are the same as referenced in the manual, table 25-10.

The interrupt handlers can now be written in C. Use the `#pragma INTERRUPT(method_name, IRQ)` to ensure that the methods are correctly linked to the interrupts.

Because we will enter the Interrupt System Mode whenever an interrupt occurs we also need to define a [stack](https://github.com/flomath/fluxos/blob/interrupts/boot.asm) for this mode. If this is not done, we will receive Memory Abort Exceptions whenever we are trying to call a method in the ISR.

#### Activate an IRQ

To activate an interrupt for a device, you will have to enable a bit in the MPU_INTC_INTCPS_MIR register. See table 10-4 in the OMAP reference and use our method `void interrupt_add_listener(uint32_t irq, interrupt_callback* listener)`.
