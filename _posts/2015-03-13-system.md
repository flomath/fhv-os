## HAL

### UART
Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter is a serial port which allows the MC to communicate with other devices such as input sensors, LCDs or other computers. Sending the data is done bit by bit with a so called baud rate. This rate is the total amount of bits transmitted per second (bits/sec). The UART does not has any clock - thats why it is asynchronous. 

+ General rule of thumb for baud rates: 9600
+ RxD (Receive)
+ TxD (Transmit)
+ Gnd

**UART Packet**   
Start-Bit (Logic 0)   
Data Byte (~8 Bit)   
Parity Bit (Optional)   
Stop-Bit (Logic 1)   

**DMA-Transmission/Reception**   
[17.4.2.4.2] DMA Transmission    
Data in the TX FIFO are automatically transmitted and the end of the transmission is signaled by the THR_REG empty (TX FIFO empty resp. UART_IER.THR_IT).

[17.3.2.4.3] DMA Reception    
At each received byte the RX FIFO trigger level (one char) is reached and DMA request is generated. The end is signaled by EOF interrupt.
