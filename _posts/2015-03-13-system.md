### UART
Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter is a serial port which allows the MC to communicate with other devices such as input sensors, LCDs or other computers. Sending the data is done bit by bit with a so called baud rate. This rate is the total amount of bits transmitted per second (bits/sec). The UART does not has any clock - thats why it is asynchronous. 

+ General rule of thumb for baud rates: 9600
+ RxD (Receive)
+ TxD (Transmit)
+ Gnd

**UART Packet**   
Start-Bit (Logic 0)   
Data Byte (~8 Bit)   
Parity Bit (Optional)   
Stop-Bit (Logic 1)
