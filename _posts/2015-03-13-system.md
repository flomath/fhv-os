## HAL

The architecture of our HAL is splitted into different layers to reach a more reliable system for exchanging those. This is needed to change to a different board for example. (The table below shows the three layers: changing to a new board architecture, only the "HAL Implementation" has to be exchanged)

| Layers             | Description |
| ------             | ----------- |
| Driver             | Drivers are accessed via System-Calls |
| HAL Interfaces     | HAL is accessed via functions, which are declared in this layer |
| HAL Implementation | Implemented methods of declareded functions |

### UART
Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter is a serial port which allows the MC to communicate with other devices such as input sensors, LCDs or other computers. Sending the data is done bit by bit with a so called baud rate. This rate is the total amount of bits transmitted per second (bits/sec). The UART does not has any clock - thats why it is asynchronous. 

+ General rule of thumb for baud rates: 9600
+ RxD (Receive)
+ TxD (Transmit)
+ Gnd

**UART Packet**   
Start-Bit (Logic 0)   
Data Byte (~8 Bit)   
Parity Bit (Optional)   
Stop-Bit (Logic 1)   

For each word given by the UART transmission the Starterbit is added to the word and notifies the receiver that data will be sent soon. The transmitter can add a parity bit after sending all data for simple error handling at the receivers side. It must though have a stop bit, otherwise the word will be discarded. 

**DMA-Transmission/Reception**   
[17.4.2.4.2] DMA Transmission    
Data in the TX FIFO are automatically transmitted and the end of the transmission is signaled by the THR_REG empty (TX FIFO empty resp. UART_IER.THR_IT).

[17.3.2.4.3] DMA Reception    
At each received byte the RX FIFO trigger level (one char) is reached and DMA request is generated. The end is signaled by EOF interrupt.

**RS232**    
The RS232 communication sends either 1, called a *Mark* or 0, called *Space*. During idle state the communication continiously transmit 1.
