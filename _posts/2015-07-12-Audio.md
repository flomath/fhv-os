## Audio
The operating system offers methods to play audio via the audio output on the beagleboard. To make sound work we used different interfaces on the board which will be discussed in the following chapters.

### MCBSP
The MCBSP or Multichannel Buffered Serial Port offers a full-duplex serial interface between the board and other connected devices. The interface can communicate with a huge amount of different peripherals, such as audio or video devices. For our application we used the audio device using I2S (Inter-IC sound). The beagleboard provides five different McBSP modules, named McBSP1 for digital baseband data, McBSP2 for audio data (with buffer), McBSP3 for bluetooth voice data, McBSP4 for DBB voice data and McBSP5 for MIDI data.

The modules vital to audio are the McBSP2, which we actually used and the McBSP5 for midi data. In feature releases we could load a midi song, process it and play it via the analog audio output over Inter-IC sound (I2S). The module is configured in order to receive and transmit data with 32 bit word length.

### I2S
The I2S or Inter-IC Sound format is a standard to exchange data between two devices connected on a circuit board. The bus is based on three wires: the bit clock (SCK), the word select line (WS) and the serial data line (SD). One of the two devices acts as Master and must generate the clock and the word select line signals. The data line can be created either by the master or the slave device. The data is transmitted in an alternating manner on the right and the left channel. This is indicated by the WS line so that if the left channel is on, the WS is low and if the right channel sends data, the WS is high.

The McBSP can recognize the alternating because of the WS transition, otherwise both devices must know the word size. The following figure (from the OMAP35x reference manual) shows the signal activity with its alternating phases.

### TPS65950
The last part of our audio setup with the beagleboard is the TPS65950. This device is a power-management and audio coder and decoder. It includes five digital-to-analog (DAC) converters and two analog-to-digital converters (ADC). We used the McBSP as master and therefore, the TPS65950 is the slave which receives frame sync and the bit clock. We only used a small amount of the broad spectrum available to configure this module. A few nice addons for our operating system would be the usage of digital audio filters or the headset pop-noise cancellation. A list of all available features can be found in the TPS65950 Integrated Power Management and Audio Codec â€“ Silicon Revision 1.2.

The following figure shows part of the OMAP35x environment using the TSP65950 (from the OMAP35x reference manual).
The TPS65950 is responsible in order to route the audio data from the McBSP to the actual DA converter (digital/analog). The DA converter then sends the signal to the headset jack via TXL/TXR (left and right). We set some basic settings on the module such as headphone amplifier with gain of 0dB, turn on the 16bit audio serial interface, and a sampling rate of 48kHz. This setting allows a fluent and high quality playback of audio files, which most of them are compressed to 48kHz in the consumer field.
