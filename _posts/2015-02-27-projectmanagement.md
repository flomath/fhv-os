For this project we are using a trimmed version of SCRUM. As toolset we are relying on the github internal capabilities like issues and milestones.

## Scrum Task Board
All of our tasks (represented as issues) are visible in our scrum task board consisting of the columns Backlog, Ready, In Progress and Done. The Backlog column makes all items of the sprint backlog visible. The next column contains all items which are ready to be worked on, followed by the In Progress column. This column shows other team members or stakeholders who is working on which task. The last column gives an overview of already done and finished tasks. 

**Waffle.io** provides the possibility to show the github issues in the previously described scrum task board and adds scrum points and assigned members view.

The board is accessible via [https://waffle.io/flomath/fhv-os](https://waffle.io/flomath/fhv-os).

## Milestones

### Sprint 1 - Ideas, Brainstorming and Kickoff
The first sprint is to define the basic concept of our operating system and the possible application area. It also contains the very basic architecture thoughts which will be refined in the following sprints.
