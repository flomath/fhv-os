## There is work to do

### Strict separation of User/Kernel Layer

A process is currently able to access kernel methods. In a future version this should be forbidden. However this issue must wait until `yield` gets implemented as our processes have to use our semaphore directly.

### Yield

A way to schedule away without needing to wait for the timer should be implemented. This is necessary for the semaphore to be called by a syscall as no IRQ will happen during it. Our current implementation of the semaphore waits for the IRQ to happen thats why our system would wait forever.

### Improve System stability

Currently our system may hang forever after a few minutes. This is probably due some implementation error in the scheduling method. Fixing this should massively improve the systems stability.

### Audio performance

Using a audio buffer would improve our audio performance.

### Driver management

Fluxos has a lack of a driver management. Currently our drivers are just initialized in our kernel directly.
